Installing Nicad5 on Windows 10
-------------------------------
Step 1: Install Linux as a subsystem for Windows 10

    - Be sure that you enable Linux as a subsystem on your Windows machine. Refer to link: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-linux-distros-windows-10
    - To install Linux distribution without using Windows Store, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual

Step 2: Install TXL programming language

    - Open the link: https://www.txl.ca/txl-download.html
    - Select Linux x86 (64 bit) for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, Mageia GCC 4.8 or later
    - Agree and download the file
    - Extract the tar file and move it to the C: drive
    - Run Ubuntu subsystem that you installed in Step 1
    - Use "cd /mnt/c" to go to the C: drive of your Windows 10
    - Go to the extracted folder of TXL
    - Run the command with administrator privilege, e.g., "sudo ./install"
    - Follow the installation steps
    - TXL is successfully installed if the message 'install TXL' appears
    
Step 3: Install Nicad5
    
    - Go to the commit assistant project
    - Copy and paste the Nicad5 folder to the C: drive
    - Use the Ubuntu subsystem to access the folder
    - Edit the command scripts "nicad5" and "nicad5cross" in this 
         directory to specify the directory where you installed Nicad.  
		 For example, if you put Nicad in
         /usr/local/lib/nicad5, you would modify the scripts to say:

              LIB=/usr/local/lib/nicad5
    - Run the command "sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/nicad5"
    - Run the command "sudo cp -r . /usr/local/lib/nicad5"
    - Test Nicad5 by running the command "nicad5 blocks java /mnt/c/nicad5/systems/JHotDraw54b1 type3-2c-report"
